Assumptions & Notes
Dates must be within property availability range.

Bookings cannot overlap existing bookings.

start_date must be before end_date.

Pagination defaults to 10 items per page.

Error responses follow consistent JSON structure with meaningful messages.

# Testing Note
Property tests

First, create a property (POST /properties).

Fetch it with GET /properties and GET /properties/:id/availability.

Booking tests

Use the propertyâ€™s id from the first step.

Test overlapping bookings to verify error handling.

Try dates outside the propertyâ€™s availability to see validation in action.

Pagination test

Create multiple properties.

Use GET /properties?page=2&limit=5 to check pagination logic.
